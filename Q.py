# Certainly! Hereâ€™s a list of 50 beginner-level Python OOP questions to help you get started with Object-Oriented Programming concepts:

# ### Basic Concepts

# 1. **Define a Class and Create an Object:**
#    - Create a simple `Car` class with attributes like `make`, `model`, and `year`. Create an object of this class.

# 2. **Instance Variables and Methods:**
#    - Create a `Person` class with attributes `name` and `age`. Add a method `greet()` that prints a greeting message.

# 3. **Constructor Method (`__init__`):**
#    - Define a `Book` class with attributes `title`, `author`, and `pages`. Initialize these attributes using a constructor.

# 4. **Class Variables:**
#    - Create a `Dog` class with a class variable `species` set to "Canine". Create several instances and show that they share the same `species` value.

# 5. **Modify Object Attributes:**
#    - Create a `Student` class with attributes `name` and `grade`. Add a method to change the `grade` of a student.

# 6. **Encapsulation:**
#    - Implement a `BankAccount` class with private attributes `_balance` and methods `deposit()` and `withdraw()` to modify the balance.

# 7. **Inheritance:**
#    - Create a `Vehicle` class with attributes `make` and `model`. Create a `Car` subclass that inherits from `Vehicle` and adds an attribute `number_of_doors`.

# 8. **Method Overriding:**
#    - Inherit a `Bird` class from an `Animal` class and override the `sound()` method to print "Chirp" instead of a generic sound.

# 9. **Polymorphism:**
#    - Create a `Shape` base class with a method `area()`. Implement this method in `Circle` and `Rectangle` subclasses.

# 10. **`super()` Keyword:**
#     - Use `super()` in a subclass constructor to call the constructor of the parent class.

# 11. **Class Methods (`@classmethod`):**
#     - Define a `Product` class with a class method `from_string()` that creates a `Product` instance from a string with details separated by a hyphen.

# 12. **Static Methods (`@staticmethod`):**
#     - Implement a `MathOperations` class with a static method `add_numbers(a, b)` that returns the sum of two numbers.

# 13. **`__str__()` Method:**
#     - Add a `__str__()` method to the `Employee` class to return a formatted string representation of the object.

# 14. **Operator Overloading:**
#     - Overload the `+` operator in a `Vector` class to add two vectors together.

# 15. **Property Decorators (`@property`):**
#     - Implement a `Rectangle` class with attributes `length` and `width`. Use the `@property` decorator to calculate the area as a property.

# 16. **Multiple Inheritance:**
#     - Create two classes `Bird` and `Flying`, and then create a subclass `FlyingBird` that inherits from both.

# 17. **Mixin Classes:**
#     - Create a `LoggerMixin` class with a `log()` method, and mix it into another class like `Transaction`.

# 18. **Abstract Base Class (`abc` module):**
#     - Define an abstract base class `Shape` with an abstract method `area()`. Implement the `area()` method in a subclass `Square`.

# 19. **Class Inheritance:**
#     - Create a base class `Employee` with a subclass `Manager`. The `Manager` class should inherit attributes and methods from `Employee`.

# 20. **Creating Getters and Setters:**
#     - Implement getter and setter methods in a `Person` class for the `age` attribute.

# ### Intermediate Concepts

# 21. **Method Resolution Order (MRO):**
#     - Create classes with multiple inheritance and print the method resolution order using the `mro()` method.

# 22. **Data Hiding:**
#     - Implement a class with private attributes and provide access through public methods.

# 23. **Object Comparison:**
#     - Overload the `__eq__` method in a `Person` class to compare two `Person` objects based on their attributes.

# 24. **Interface:**
#     - Create an interface using an abstract base class with methods `start()` and `stop()`. Implement these methods in `Car` and `Bike` classes.

# 25. **Method Chaining:**
#     - Create a `Car` class with methods `start()`, `accelerate()`, and `stop()` that can be chained together.


# 27. **Decorator Pattern:**
#     - Implement a `Pizza` class and use a decorator pattern to add toppings like `Cheese` and `Pepperoni`.

# 28. **Composition:**
#     - Create a `Car` class that contains an `Engine` class as a component.

# 29. **Association:**
#     - Implement a `Teacher` and `Student` class where a teacher can have multiple students associated with them.

# 30. **Aggregation:**
#     - Implement a `Department` and `Employee` class where a department can have multiple employees, but employees can exist independently of the department.

# 31. **Create a Custom Exception:**
#     - Define a custom exception `InsufficientFundsError` for a `BankAccount` class that raises the exception when a withdrawal amount is greater than the balance.

# 32. **Immutable Objects:**
#     - Implement an immutable `Point` class where the attributes cannot be changed after the object is created.

# 33. **Copying Objects (`__copy__` and `__deepcopy__`):**
#     - Create a class with nested objects and demonstrate shallow and deep copying.

# 34. **Type Checking and Casting:**
#     - Implement type checking in a method that accepts only instances of a specific class and cast attributes to a certain type.

# 35. **Design a Library System:**
#     - Create a `Library`, `Book`, and `Member` class to simulate a simple library system.

# 36. **Decorator with Arguments:**
#     - Create a decorator that logs the execution time of a method, and allow it to accept a custom log message as an argument.

# 37. **Observer Pattern:**
#     - Implement an observer pattern where objects of a `NewsAgency` class notify registered `Subscriber` objects when news is published.

# 38. **Factory Pattern:**
#     - Implement a factory pattern to create different types of `Animal` objects based on a given input.

# 39. **Create a Simple Chat Application:**
#     - Implement `User` and `Message` classes to simulate a simple chat application.

# 40. **Method Overloading:**
#     - Implement a class with methods that have the same name but different numbers of parameters (simulate method overloading using default arguments).

# 41. **File Handling in OOP:**
#     - Create a `FileManager` class with methods to read and write to a file, and handle exceptions if the file does not exist.

# 42. **Context Managers (`__enter__` and `__exit__`):**
#     - Implement a `DatabaseConnection` class as a context manager to handle opening and closing the database connection.

# 43. **Implement a Music Player:**
#     - Create classes `Song`, `Playlist`, and `MusicPlayer` to simulate a basic music player application.

# 44. **Object Serialization (`pickle` module):**
#     - Implement a class and serialize its objects to a file using the `pickle` module.

# 45. **Iterator Protocol (`__iter__` and `__next__`):**
#     - Create a `Range` class that implements the iterator protocol to generate a sequence of numbers.

# 46. **Command Pattern:**
#     - Implement a command pattern to create undoable commands in a text editor application.

# 47. **Refactor Code with OOP:**
#     - Take a procedural codebase (e.g., a simple calculator) and refactor it into an OOP-based design.

# 48. **Data Validation in OOP:**
#     - Implement a `Form` class with attributes and validate the data using methods.

# 49. **Creating a REST API with OOP:**
#     - Simulate the structure of a REST API with classes representing different resources (e.g., `User`, `Post`, `Comment`).

# 50. **Build a Simple E-commerce System:**
#     - Create classes for `Product`, `ShoppingCart`, and `Order` to simulate a basic e-commerce system.

# These questions should give you plenty of practice to build a solid foundation in Python OOP principles. Happy coding!
